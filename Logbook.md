## Some Guidence from ChatGPT (GPT-4)

The PDF details a project assignment titled "A Secure Ticket Platform" for a course on "Logic for Security." The project involves designing a secure and privacy-friendly mobile app for a consortium of venues (theaters, opera houses, cinemas, concert venues) to sell tickets online. The assignment requires students to work in groups of up to three and submit a report that includes a proposal for the ticket platform design. This design must consider several entities:

- Venue providers' servers hosting information about available seats.
- The customer's app.
- Devices at each venue provider that check tickets upon entrance.
- Identity providers (e.g., MitID).
- Payment services (e.g., the bank issuing customer's credit cards or services like Mobile Pay).

The report should detail the entities involved, trust assumptions, initial distribution of keys, and security protocols between these entities formalized in the AnB language and verified with OFMC for two sessions. It should also include development flaws found in initial attempts, design decisions, modeling in AnB, security goals, an informal argument for privacy, and an analysis of accountability (ensuring customers cannot deny buying a ticket and venue providers cannot charge for a ticket not bought).

Additional considerations include assumptions about initial knowledge (servers have a public/private key pair, but customers do not), channel implementation, necessity of trusted parties, accountability in case of a dishonest customer, and protocol well-typedness.

To build this protocol step by step, follow these guidelines:

- Identify Entities and Trust Relationships: Start by defining the roles of the servers, app, venue checking devices, identity, and payment providers. Establish trust assumptions and key distribution mechanisms.

- Define Security Protocols: Develop protocols for secure communication between these entities, considering encryption, authentication, and integrity. Use the AnB language for formalization and OFMC for verification.

- Development and Design Decisions: Document the development process, noting any security flaws identified and the rationale behind each design decision.

- Modeling and Security Goals: Simplify the real-world scenario into a model that can be analyzed, specifying the security goals like confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation.

- Privacy Considerations: Argue how the system ensures privacy by limiting access to personal information to only what is necessary for each entity's task.

- Accountability Analysis: Ensure the system provides mechanisms for accountability, preventing customers from denying ticket purchases and protecting them from being unjustly charged.

- Special Considerations: Address initial knowledge, channel implementation, necessity of trusted parties, legal accountability, and protocol well-typedness as per the assignment's requirements.

- Keep a Development Log: Document each version of the protocol, including any attacks found and problems identified, as a "lab logbook."

This step-by-step guide, based on the assignment requirements, outlines a comprehensive approach to designing a secure and privacy-friendly ticketing platform.
